# Flutter Dependency Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸ”§ Common Flutter Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Material Color Utilities Version Conflict

**Error Message:**
```
Because every version of flutter_test from sdk depends on material_color_utilities 0.11.1 and
blitzit_flutter depends on material_color_utilities ^0.8.0, flutter_test from sdk is forbidden.
```

**Solution:**
1. **Run the fix script:**
   ```bash
   fix_dependencies.bat
   ```

2. **Or manually fix:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   del pubspec.lock
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Issue 2: Go Router Version Conflict

**Error Message:**
```
The current Dart SDK version is X.X.X
Because blitzit_flutter depends on go_router ^12.1.3 which requires SDK version >=3.0.0 <4.0.0
```

**Solution:**
Update Flutter SDK:
```bash
flutter upgrade
flutter --version
```

### Issue 3: General Dependency Resolution
